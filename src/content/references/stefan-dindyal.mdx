I’m pleased to recommend Javier for any full stack development role. I had the opportunity to work closely with him, and he consistently demonstrated strong intuition, technical curiosity, and a proactive approach to problem-solving. Nearly every task assigned to him was completed independently, and when he did need input, he always sought out the right resources rather than letting himself get stuck. Javier also has a real talent for automation. His work with Power Automate flows was especially impressive and often elevated the overall efficiency of our team. He's a reliable, thoughtful, and highly capable developer who brings both initiative and follow-through. I’m confident he’ll be an asset to any engineering team.
